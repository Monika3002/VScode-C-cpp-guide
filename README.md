2. **Run the Installer:** Run the installer, customize your preferences, and set the installation directory (e.g., `C:\mingw-w64`).
3. **Add to System Path:** During installation, ensure that you select the option to add Mingw-w64 to the system PATH.

## Step 3: Update System Path Variable

1. **Find System Properties:** Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and select "Properties."
2. **Open Advanced System Settings:** Click on "Advanced system settings."
3. **Open Environment Variables:** Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. **Edit Path Variable:** In the "System variables" section, select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
5. **Add Mingw-w64 to Path:** Click "New" and add the path to the `bin` directory of Mingw-w64 (e.g., `C:\mingw-w64\mingw64\bin`).
6. **Save Changes:** Click "OK" to close each of the dialog boxes.

## Step 4: Install C/C++ Extension in Visual Studio Code

2. **Create a New File:** Right-click and choose "New File." Name it with a `.cpp` extension, e.g., `main.cpp`.
3. **Write Some Code:** Open `main.cpp` and write a simple C++ program.
4. **Install Code Runner:** Search for "Code Runner" in Extensions View and install the one provided by Jun Han.

## Step 6: Run Your C++ Code

1. Open your `main.cpp` file.
2. Right-click anywhere in the editor.
3. Select "Run Code" to execute your C++ program.
